<ul>
  <li>you get a letter from us asking you to apply</li>

</ul>
<p>If  you did not receive any letter about the Old Age Security pension the month  after you turned 64, <a href="/en/employment-social-development/corporate/contact/oas.html">contact  us</a> to find out if you need to apply.</p>
<h2 id="h2.2">Step 2: Decide when you want your OAS to start</h2>

<ul>
  <li>start receiving your pension at age 65 (your  pension will start the month after your 65th birthday)</li>
  <li>start receiving your pension at a specific date  that you choose</li>
